# avr_hvpp

Simple hvpp programmer on atmega8 and 1602A lcd with twi extention<br>

Kicad schematics and pcb's coming soon.

Sure you can plug mega328 into socket and<br>
write code in arduino ide..<br>

I'm thinking about coding main menu in C and others: <br>
lcd, twi, adc and hvpp libraries in assembly.<br>
Pure C version I coded was compiled to 8k (w/o a few bytes)<br>
You can find a working hex file on hardware folder.<br>
Some more errors has to be fixed and I may commit its gas version too<br>

All work except kicad were processed on orange pc.<br>
It's very hard to edit pcb and schematics on orange<br>
(opengl works and 3d model turns but don't do that,<br>
really, beleve me)

And more. I'm learning now. Doing a lot of compromised<br>
steps in programming. These are like a practical answers<br>
for some questions and thus not perfect<br>
